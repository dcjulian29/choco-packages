choco-packages
==============

This is a collection of Chocolatey NuGet packages that I've either created or adapted to my opinion of where they should be installed to and how they should install.

This collection started as a result of a few bad packages on the public feed and less than stellar responses to emails and offers of help. I also did not agree with many of the "placement" and "defaults" that were/are provided by the authors of some of the packages in the public feed. These are not the fault of Chocolatey directly, but is an unfortunate side-effect of a public open repository. They recently introduced moderation and that should go along way to raise the bar of quality but I think that the "clean-up" of all of the packages will be a difficult process. The new versions allow for parameters to be passed into the package so I hope that package maintainers, including myself, will start using them.

As for me, my use of Chocolatey is to disable the "Chocolatey" repository and use my personal repository. You should not trust me or agree with the way I install applications/tools either. However, this repository and the Chocolatey feed is public and anyone is free to use it. The Chocolatey feed is located at <https://www.myget.org/F/dcjulian29-chocolatey/>. I make no guarantees of the quality of these packages or that any package that exist today will exist tomorrow. As my taste in programs/tools change, so will my package repository and I will delete any packages that Iâ€™m not using anymore.

If you do decide to use it and find a bug in or a suggestion for one of the packages, please let me know.
