choco-packages
==============

This is a collection of Chocolatey NuGet packages that I've either created or adapted to my way of installing them.

The need for this collection of packages including ones that are otherwise available on the public feed are unfortunately due to the fact that I don't trust non-program authors to package the application nor do I agree with many of the "placement" and "defaults" that are provided by the authors in the public feed, not to mention several of the packages have severe bugs which are not the fault of chocolatey directly. So for me, I'll disable the "chocolatey" repository and use my personal repository.

You should not trust me or agree with the way I install applications/tools either. However, this repository and the chocolatey feed is public and anyone is free to use it. The chocolatey feed is located at <https://www.myget.org/F/dcjulian29-chocolatey/>. If you do decide to use it and find a bug in one of the packages, please let me know.
