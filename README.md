choco-packages
==============

This is a collection of Chocolatey NuGet packages that I've either created or adapted to my opinion of where they should be installed to and/or how they should install.

This collection started as a result of a few bad packages on the public feed and less than stellar responses to emails and offers of help. I also did not agree with many of the "placement" and "defaults" that were/are provided by the authors of some of the packages in the public feed. These are not the fault of Chocolatey directly, but is an unfortunate side-effect of a public open repository. They introduced moderation and virus-checking that have gone along way to raise the bar of quality.

As for me, my use of Chocolatey is to disable the "Chocolatey" repository and use my personal repository which in turn uses the public feed upstream due to a bug that ignores the source priority. The bug is reported and should be fixed in the next couple of versions...

As for my specific packages, you should not trust me or agree with the way I install applications and tools. However, my repository and the Chocolatey feed is public and anyone is free to use or not. The Chocolatey feed for these packages is located at <https://www.myget.org/F/dcjulian29-chocolatey/>. I make no guarantees of the quality of these packages or that any package that exist today will exist tomorrow. As my taste in programs/tools change, so will my package repository and I will delete any packages that Iâ€™m not using anymore and old versions of the package.

If you do decide to use it and find a bug in or a suggestion for one of the packages, please let me know.
