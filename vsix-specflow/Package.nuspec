    <description>SpecFlow aims at bridging the communication gap between domain experts and developers by binding business readable behavior specifications and examples to the underlying implementation. Our mission is to provide a pragmatic and frictionless approach to Specification-By-Example for .NET projects. SpecFlow is open source and provided under a BSD license. SpecFlow also supports the concepts of Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and Behavior Driven Development (BDD), which are often used synonymously with Specification-By-Example.</description>
